# Analytics-vidya-hackathron
It was the code written by me for the analytics hackathon. I ranked 161 out of around 1500 + 
This was a hackathron wghere we had to predict the electric consumption based on the weather and time. The catch was we couldnot use lsrtm or arimsa model as dates were random.
Therefore regression was used .
I used averaging stack model as i ofen got good result from it.
