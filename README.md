# Analytics-vidya-hackathron

## File name electricityf.ipynb
It was the code written by me for the analytics hackathon. I ranked 10 out of around 1500 + :) 
This was a hackathron wghere we had to predict the electric consumption based on the weather and time. The problem was we couldnot use the whole training data for prediction. We had to use only past to predict  the futuee, and were not allowed to use the whole data at a time. 
Therefore regression was used .
I used averaging stack model as I ofen gives better result than a single model.
